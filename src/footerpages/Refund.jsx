              In the event of the cancellation of the fundraising campaign before reaching the
              targeted amount, all contributed funds will be promptly refunded
              to the respective investors. Users who receive a refund due to the
              campaign cancellation are exempt from paying fees when
              reinvesting the refunded amount.

              including agreements related to the maintenance of the property with the
              Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), will be signed. Refunds
              are not applicable once the fundraising campaign reaches its
              target, and the property transaction proceeds.

              <SubHeading>Campaign Not Reaching 100% Subscription:</SubHeading>
              Despite our meticulous due diligence process, there might be instances where a fundraising campaign does not reach 100% subscription. This can occur due to market fluctuations, investor preferences, or other unforeseen factors. In such cases, the campaign may proceed with the received subscriptions, and the property acquisition will be adjusted accordingly.
