          Venq investments are meant to be held for the full 5 year term and are
          not listed on an exchange. We provide a Secondary Transfer Facility on
          our platform where you can sell before the end of the term.<br></br><br></br> This
          facility is only available for 2 weeks at a time, twice per year. You
          may not be able to exit early, making this an illiquid investment.
          Please do not invest if you do not intend to hold for the full term.<br></br><br></br>
          Even with the Secondary Transfer Facility, there is no guarantee you
          can sell your investment.

        <SubHeading>Warnings and Disclosures</SubHeading>
        <Content>
          Real estate investment carries risk. Investors on Venq do not directly
          own property, rather they own a share in a private entity that owns
          the property.<br></br><br></br>Your investment value can fluctuate and anticipated
          returns may not happen as predicted. You could also experience delays
          in rental income payments or difficulty selling the property at the
          end of the term.<br></br><br></br> In some cases, government restrictions may limit the
          potential buyers for a property. Venq investments differ significantly
          from direct property ownership, real estate funds, REITs or other real
          estate securities. If Venq ceases operations, you could experience
          losses, costs and payment delays.<br></br><br></br> Using credit or borrowed money to
          invest carries greater risk as you would still need to meet repayment
          obligations even if your investment declines.
