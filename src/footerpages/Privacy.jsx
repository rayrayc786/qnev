          <Content>
            The security of your personal data is important to us and we have
            invested significant resources to protect its confidentiality. When
            using external service providers, we require they adhere to the same
            standards as us.<br></br>
            <br></br> Personal data may be transferred or stored outside of your
            country of residence. Regardless of location, we take all reasonably
            necessary steps to ensure personal data is kept secure. The Internet
            is not a secure communication medium and sending/receiving data over
            the Internet carries risks like third party access and interference.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>Information passing over the Internet may be transmitted
            internationally (even between sender and recipient in the same
            country) via countries with weaker privacy/data protection laws than
            your country of residence. We do not accept responsibility or
            liability for confidentiality, security or integrity of your
            personal data in connection with Internet transmission.<br></br>
            <br></br> However, we take all reasonable care in collecting,
            storing, processing and disclosing your personal data and have
            implemented internal security procedures to minimize the risk of
            unauthorized access.<br></br>
            <br></br> Because of these procedures we may ask for proof of
            identity before disclosing any of your personal information. To help
            protect your personal data and reduce interception risk by
            unauthorized third parties, our secure servers use industry standard
            SSL and TLS technology when you submit information through our
            website.<br></br>
